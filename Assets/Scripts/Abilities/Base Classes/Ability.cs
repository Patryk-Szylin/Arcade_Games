/// @description    :                           This is a base class for creating new abiltiies, every deriving class will have to implement 
///                                                 TriggerAbility();
///                                                 Initilise(...);

///                                             Scriptable object in this case behaves as a data storage and lives in unity as an .asset, therefore designers have easier approach creating
///                                             variations of particular effects (e.g. Different rockets, with different effects and stats).

///                                             An example use case of this class is a Ability_RocketLauncher script. It implements Initlise() by using 
///                                             the values from base and its own class (Ability.cs and Ability_RocketLauncher.cs) and setting those values in its target projectile that
///                                             it is going to use. i.e. Projectile_Rocket.cs.

///                                             Every derived class will use m_projectilePrefab by getting appropriate component from targetObj.
///                                             Rocket Use Case: m_projectilePrefab gets Projectile_Rocket.cs component and sets its values.

/// <para name="m_projectilePrefab">            A reference to projectile prefab. Each ability type will have different projectiles. Each projectile implments Launch() and OnCollisionHit()
